    <h1>ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOICE</h1>
<h2>What is Active Voice?</h2>

<p>A sentence is in active voice when the subject does the action.<br>

Examples:<br>

Ali writes a letter.<br>

She cooks food.<br>

They play cricket.</p>

<h2>What is Passive Voice?</h2>

<p>A sentence is in passive voice when the action is done to the subject.<br>

Examples:<br>

A letter is written by Ali.<br>

Food is cooked by her.<br>

Cricket is played by them.</p>

<h2>Basic Rule (Active → Passive)</h2>

<p>Object of the active sentence becomes the subject.<br>

Use helping verb according to tense.<br>

Use 3rd form of verb (past participle).<br>

Use by before the doer (subject).</p>

<h3> Passive Voice Formula</h3>

<p>Subject + helping verb + past participle + by + object</p>

<h3> Active to Passive (Common Tenses)</h3>
<h4> Simple Present</h4>

<p>Active: She writes a letter.<br>
Passive: A letter is written by her.</p>

<h4> Present Continuous</h4>

<p>Active: He is cleaning the room.
Passive: The room is being cleaned by him.</p>
<h4>Simple Past</h4>

<p>Active: Ali wrote a letter.<br>
Passive: A letter was written by Ali.</p>

<h4>Simple Future</h4>

<p>Active: They will complete the work.<br>
Passive: The work will be completed by them.</p>

<h3> When NOT to use Passive Voice</h3>

<p>When subject is unknown or unimportant

In informal or spoken English<br>

Example:<br>
I did my homework. (Better than passive)</p>

<h3>Practice Exercise</h3>

<p>Change into passive voice:<br>

She cooks food.<br>

Ali cleaned the room.<br>

They will solve the problem<br>.

Answers:<br>

Food is cooked by her.<br>

The room was cleaned by Ali.<br>

The problem will be solved by them.</p>
